# Netflix Clone

Created a clone of Netflix's website.

## Description

I used this app to hone my skills within ReactJS. I was able to get more practice and better understandings of React hooks such as (***useContext***, ***useEffect***, and ***custom hooks***).While developing this app, I was able to get my hands on technologies that I had never previously used. These include:
- Firebase (Firestore)
- Styled Components
- Compound Components
- Fuse
- Jest

I learned how to implement different types of tests (i.e. E2E, Integration, and Unit Tests) along with the importance of testing. This app has 80% coverage. I took advantage of 3rd party libraries and technologies. For example, ***Fuse***. ***Fuse*** was used to provide search functionality, filtering down the data based on user input.
